# Advanced Features

The JVM and other VMs have many Advanced features out of the box available to languages that can be compiled to its bytecode.  Clearly the JVM was designed with the Java language in mind, which is usually the case with other VMs.  For the JVM this means that the bytecode has an object abstraction which handles different types of method calls.  

Other features include:
- Garbage collection
- Threading
- Operating features like file systems

## Disadvantages

While these features are great it's not possible to compile a language like C or C++ to the JVM because they require manual memory management.
